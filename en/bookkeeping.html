          <h1>BOOKKEEPING</h1>
                  <p>Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, including sales, purchases, income, receipts, and payments made by an individual or an organization.</p>
                  <p>A bookkeeper, also known as an “accounting clerk” or “accounting technician,” is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of an organization.</p>
                  <p>The bookkeeper is usually responsible for writing the daybooks — recording purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. Furthermore, the bookkeeper will ensure that all transactions are recorded in the correct daybook, supplier ledger, customer ledger, or general ledger. The bookkeeper also brings the books to the trial balance stage.

            <h1 class="featurette text-left">BUSINESS ADVISORY SERVICES</h1>
            In the area of business advisory services, we offer computer software consulting, human resources assistance, internal control systems set-up, monthly accounting supervision, and import-export consulting.
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Pricing</h1>
            <p>
            Our pricing policy is simple. You pay only for the time we spend on your company. From month to month, your transactions will vary in number and complexity. We will send you a highly detailed invoice specifying how much time we have spent on each aspect of the work we have performed on your behalf. This type of invoicing is designed to give you the full picture of the real cost of your accounting. At some point, you may decide that it’s time to hire an employee to do your books. If you should do so, we can help you manage the transition. We will help you to set up your own bookkeeping system and transfer your database from our computers to yours. Then we will teach your employee what he or she needs to know, repeating the instructions as often as necessary and supervising the work, and we’ll continue until you are confident that the employee is doing everything correctly. We will be happy to assist you at any stage in your business.<br>
              <br>
              <p class="well">
              Our hourly rate is $60 on a per-minute basis.<br> 
              <br>
              Our staff is very experienced — you can trust that our work will be done accurately and quickly. Bookkeeping is a very competitive business, and the successful bookkeeper must be prepared to provide high-quality work at competitive prices. We understand this, and that's why we are still in business after 20 years.<br>
