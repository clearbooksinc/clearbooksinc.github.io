                <b>Warning: Investing in schemes that promise you tax free withdrawals from RRSPs and RRIFs could result in the loss of your retirement savings</b><br>
                <br>The Canada Revenue Agency is finding an increasing number of questionable registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and registered retirement income fund (RRIF) tax-free withdrawal schemes. The CRA is warning that investing in such schemes could result in you losing your entire retirement savings to unscrupulous promoters, as well as a reassessment of your tax returns.

          <h1 class="featurette text-left">Questions and answers</h1>
           <p><b>What is the maximum amount of child care expenses I can claim?</b> Up to $7,000 per child or up to $10,000 if your child is disabled.</p>
           <p><b>During the summer I pay my 14-year old daughter to look after her little brother while my husband and I work. Can I include this on my return as a deduction?</b> Since the child care services are being provided by a person under 18 years of age who is related to you, you are not entitled to make a claim for child care expenses. When child care services are provided by an individual, the individual cannot be the eligible child's father, mother, or a supporting person</p>
           <p><b>My husband will have to pay a lot of tax this year. Can he claim the day care expenses instead of me?</b> Generally, the person with the lower net income (including zero income) must claim the child care expenses. However, if your spouse or common-law partner has the higher net income and one of the conditions below apply, he can make the claim for child care expenses.
           <br>(a) You are enrolled in an educational program that is offered by a secondary school, college, university, or other designated educational institution.
           <br>(b) You were not capable of caring for children because of a mental or physical infirmity.
           <br>(d) You were confined to a prison or similar institution for a period of at least two weeks; or
           <br>(e) You were living separate and apart from your spouse or common-law partner at the end of the year and for a period of at least 90 days beginning in that year due to a breakdown of your relationship,</p>
