          <b>What do you need to know about audits?</b> The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) selectively audits tax returns and rebate claims to ensure that all returns and claims are properly prepared and that taxpayers receive all payments to which they are entitled.
<br>
                <br>
                <b>What are your responsibilities?</b> By law, you have to keep adequate books and records in order to determine your tax obligations and entitlements. Generally, books and records must be kept for a minimum of six years. If you maintain your accounting records on a computer, you must keep them in an electronically readable format, even if you also keep a paper record. Using the services of a tax professional does not relieve you of these responsibilities. In an audit, the CRA will ask you to make available to the auditor your books and records (both paper and electronic), as well as any supporting documents; you will also be expected to supply answers to the auditor’s questions.

           Whether you are planning to open a business, buy or sell a rental property, or hire a new employee, or if your marital situation changes, you will have questions. We can answer some of these questions and explain the tax implications of different scenarios. It's always advisable to determine in advance what might happen in a given situation before taking the next step.<br>
           <br>
           The most common mistake people make is to fail to seek professional advice early on. By the time they receive an audit letter from the CRA, it’s usually too late to correct their errors. We offer you a free initial consultation to discuss your needs in advance, when you’re just starting your business or planning to do anything related to tax or business decisions.<br>

              <img src="https://www.smiley-faces.org/smiley-faces/smiley-face-thumb.gif" alt="Smiley Faces" border="0"> An architect, an artist and an accountant were discussing whether it was better to spend time with the wife or a mistress. The architect said he enjoyed time with his wife, building a solid foundation for an enduring relationship. The artist said he enjoyed time with his mistress, because of the passion and mystery he found there. The accountant said, "I like both." "Both?" The accountant replied "Yeah. If you have a wife and a mistress, they will each assume you are spending time with the other woman, and you can go to the office and get some work done."</p>
