          <b>If we make an error, we'll pay any penalties and interest you may incur.</b>

            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Personal Income Taxes</h1>
            Since 1993, we have been serving a variety of clients, including: students, foreign students, employees, the self-employed, seniors, new immigrants, non- residents with rental property in Canada, and truck drivers. We have designed our services to ensure that the needs of each client are met.
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Students</h1>
            Most students are entitled to the following tax credits:<br><br>
- Tuition and education credits<br>
- Textbooks and ancillary costs<br>
- Exemptions for scholarships, fellowships, and bursaries<br>
- Deductible interest on student loans<br>
- Moving expenses<br>
- Public transit costs<br>
- Child care costs
             <h1 class="featurette text-left">Seniors</h1>
             Canadian senior citizens are eligible to receive a wide range of tax benefits:<br><br>
- Age amount<br>
- Pension income splitting<br>
- Medical expenses<br>
- Disability amount<br>
- Workforce credit<br>
- Public transit costs<br>
- Ontario Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit<br>
- Several other tax credits and benefits to which you may be entitled, depending on your situation
<h1 class="featurette text-left">Employees</h1>
According to a Fraser Institute report, Canadians pay 42% of their income to the government as tax. This is more than they spend on food, shelter, and clothing combined. Most people are not qualified as accountants — it is important that you consult a professional to make sure that you are taking advantage of every deduction to which you are entitled. To help us maximize your refund and ensure that you get every possible tax credit and deduction, please collect and supply us with all of your receipts and income records.<br>
<br><img src="../images/important.jpeg"> Do not forget to include your previous year’s notice of assessment.
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Self Employed</h1>
            We understand that running a successful business takes a great deal of hard work and commitment, and we are dedicated to helping you as much as we can. We have the expertise to complete tax returns for:<br><br>
- Self-employed individuals<br>
- Small-business owners<br>
- Commission-only salespeople persons<br>
<h1 class="featurette text-left">Truck Drivers</h1>
            You might be a self-employed trucker, an incorporated trucker, or an employee of a carrier — each tax situation is unique. There are a number of fees and expenses related to trucking that are tax deductible, depending on your situation: meals and lodging, office supplies, cell phones, Internet connections, association dues, Comdata/Comchek fees, computer software, cleaning supplies, medical exams (physicals, or drug tests), postage fees (for invoices, or bills of lading), real estate expenses (mortgage interest, or real estate taxes), safety gear (steel-toe boots, work gloves, or cargo straps), trucking-business-related subscriptions (load board subscription fees, or trucking industry magazines), uniforms (dry-cleaning charges for uniforms or protective clothing), insurance, and permits and licenses.
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Non Residents</h1>
            If you receive income from a Canadian source but are not a resident of Canada, you may still have to pay tax on that income. Whether you are required to file an income tax return and what type of tax you must pay depend on the type of income you receive. Generally, Canadian income received by a non-resident is subject to Part XIII tax or Part I tax.<br><br><b>The most common types of Canadian income subject to Part XIII tax are:</b> dividends, rental and royalty payments, pension payments, old age security pension, Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan benefits, retiring allowances, Registered Retirement Savings Plan payments, Registered Retirement Income Fund payments, annuity payments, and management fees.<br>The interest that you receive or that is credited to you is generally exempt from Canadian withholding tax if the payer is unrelated (arm's length) to you.
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Rental Income</h1>
            If you own a rental property, you can deduct many expenses: mortgage interest, property taxes, utility costs, insurance, maintenance costs, advertising, and property management fees. If you rent out only a portion of your home, you can deduct only a portion of those costs. If your rental property is in another country and costs exceed $100,000 Canadian, then you must declare this property on your income tax return. 
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Corporate Income Taxes</h1>
            In Canada, there are Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) and other kinds of corporations. Corporations are separate legal entities, and each must complete and file an annual T2 Corporation Income Tax Return. This applies to every corporation that operates in Canada, even if it is inactive.<br><br>
            The tax year of a corporation is its fiscal period. It must file the T2 Corporation Income Tax Return within six months of the end of the fiscal period.<br><br>
            <b>Note:</b> Your corporation can be considered a personal services business (PSB) if an individual who performs services on behalf of the corporation (an "incorporated employee") is a specified shareholder of the corporation, if that individual provides services to another entity, and if the relationship between the provider of the service and the entity receiving the service could reasonably be regarded as an employee-employer relationship. If this is the case, your corporation will have very limited business deductions and will pay full corporate taxes. A PSB is also ineligible for the general rate reduction, resulting in a federal corporate tax rate of 28%. For example, in Ontario, the total tax rate would be 39.5%. If you are the owner of a PSB, you may want to reconsider being incorporated.
            <h1 class="featurette text-left">Maximize your credit and deductions</h1>
